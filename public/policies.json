These strategies, while promising, face major hurdles such as steep costs, potential constraints on cutting-edge progress, and concerns over security and the broad distribution of powerful AI capabilities.",

In the context of AI, where financial risks and operational opacity can be high, due diligence not only pressures companies to uphold transparency and regulatory compliance but also sets informal market standards for responsible AI practices. This process acts as both an incentive and a safeguard, encouraging firms to maintain robust governance while guiding investor decisions in an increasingly AI-driven economy.",

    "description": "Widespread information asymmetry and uncertainty around emerging technologies hinder effective market functioning and resource allocation. Stakeholders such as investors, insurers, and procurement bodies require accurate, consistent data to assess risks, set standards, and guide capital flows. Standardised disclosure offers a solution by creating a shared informational baseline, reducing transaction costs, and promoting competition based on value. By improving transparency, it enables more informed decision-making and helps mitigate the societal risks posed by opaque technological systems.",
